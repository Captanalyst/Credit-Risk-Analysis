Designed, built, and validated credit risk models to assess the likelihood of loan default, enabling data-driven lending decisions and reducing financial risk.

In this Credit Risk Analysis project, I designed, built, and validated predictive models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and KNN to assess loan default risk and support informed lending decisions. I began with data collection and cleaning, followed by in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations. Through extensive feature engineering—including debt-to-income ratio and credit utilization—I enhanced model accuracy and ensured data integrity. I trained and fine-tuned models using cross-validation and GridSearchCV, achieving up to 82% accuracy. Evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy guided iterative improvements. Finally, I communicated insights through visualizations and reports, highlighting key risk indicators and model interpretability using SHAP values and feature importance plots.

The dataset included key features such as Age, Sex, Job, Housing, Saving accounts, Checking account, Credit amount, Duration, and Purpose, each contributing to the prediction of credit risk. These features captured demographic details (Age, Sex), financial behavior (Saving and Checking accounts), employment status (Job), loan characteristics (Credit amount, Duration), and intent (Purpose), while categorical variables like Housing and Purpose were encoded to enhance model interpretability and performance.
